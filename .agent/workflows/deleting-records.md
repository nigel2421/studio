description: How to permanently delete landlord or client owner records
---

This workflow explains how to safely delete records for landlords or client property owners. This is a permanent action and should be done with care.

### Steps for Deleting a Landlord or Client:

1.  **Navigate to the correct section**:
    *   For investor landlords, go to **Landlords** in the sidebar.
    *   For self-managed clients, go to **Client Self Managed Units** in the sidebar.
2.  **Select the Property**: From the dropdown, choose the property where the owner/landlord is registered.
3.  **Locate the Record**: Find the card for the landlord or client you wish to delete.
4.  **Initiate Deletion**: Click the **trash can icon** on their card.
5.  **Confirm Deletion**:
    *   A confirmation dialog will appear, warning you that this action is permanent.
    *   To proceed, you must type the word **DELETE** (in all caps) into the input field.
    *   The final delete button will become active only after you type the confirmation word correctly.
6.  **Complete Deletion**: Click the final "Delete" button to permanently remove the record.

### Important Notes:

*   **What Happens When You Delete?**
    *   The landlord or client owner's profile is permanently removed from the database.
    *   All units previously assigned to them will become "unassigned."
    *   If the individual had a user account linked, their role will be demoted to a basic "viewer" and their link to the landlord/owner profile will be severed. Their user login is NOT deleted.
*   **Internal Profiles**: The "Soil Merchants" internal profile cannot be deleted.
