description: Managing user roles and permissions
---

This workflow is for administrators to manage team member access to the system.

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to User Management**: Click on **User Management** in the sidebar. This option is only visible to users with the 'admin' role.
2. **View Users**: You will see a list of all registered users in the system, including their name, email, and current role.
3. **Change a User's Role**:
   - Find the user whose role you want to change.
   - In the "Role" column, click the dropdown menu.
   - Select the new role from the available options (e.g., Agent, Viewer, Water-Meter-Reader).
   - The change is saved automatically, and the user's permissions are updated immediately.
4. **Export User List**:
   - Click the **Export CSV** button to download a complete list of all users and their current roles for auditing or external use.

### Important Notes:

- **Tenants & Landlords**: The roles for 'tenant' and 'landlord' are assigned automatically when they are created in the system and cannot be manually changed here.
- **Admin Roles**: An admin cannot demote their own account to a lower-permission role.
